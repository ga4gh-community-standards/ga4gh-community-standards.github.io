Based on the widespread interest of more general documentation of best practices
at GA4GH Connect April 2023 we're looking into a restart and reframing of the
"Standards and recommendations" parts of [{S}[B] SchemaBlocks](https://schemablocks.org)
into a general "genomic standards and use practices at GA4GH" concept.

<!--more-->

Accordingly, this new site has been implemente under the the [ga4gh-community-standards.github.io](http://ga4gh-community-standards.github.io)
domain[^1]. While only a few recommendations are available there at this time
we encourage contributions from GA4GH members.

[^1]: The site is also available through [genomestandards.org](https://genomestandards.org)
