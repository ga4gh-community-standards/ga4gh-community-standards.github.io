In the above example we have highlighted the subsequence <code>GAGTGC</code>, which starts at position 4 and ends at position 10.

Other transformations are less prone to programming errors than the alternative system \"1-start, fully-closed\".</p> <p>This same coordinate system can be used to flag insertions and deletions as a start and an end which equal each other refers to a space between two residues e.g. 4,4 would flag an event occurring between <code>GGTG</code> and <code>GAGTGC</code>.</p> What is '1-start, fully-closed'? <pre><code>    GAGTGC\nGGTGGAGTGCGCCGCCATGG\n         11111111112\n12345678901234567890\n</code></pre> <p>\"1-start, fully-closed\" is the human readable coordinate system used in all genomic data displays and reports. It indexes sequences starting at 1. This system should be used when displaying genomic data to a human because it is the correct way to refer to positions.
