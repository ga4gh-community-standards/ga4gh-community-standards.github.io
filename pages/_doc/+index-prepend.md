## {{page.title}}

SchemaBlocks is a "__cross-workstreams, cross-drivers__" initiative to document 
GA4GH object standards and prototypes, as well as common data formats and 
semantics.

<img style="float: left; margin: 20px 20px 10px 0px; width: 60px; clear: none;" src="{{ "assets/img/logo-schemablocks-120x120-no-logo.png" | relative_url}}" />Launched in December 2018, this project is still to be considered a "community 
initiative", with developing participation, leadership and governance 
structures. At its current stage, the documents can __not__ be considered 
"__authoritative GA4GH recommendations__" but rather represent documentation 
and implementation examples provided by GA4GH members.

While future products and implementations may be completely based on 
_SchemaBlocks_ components, this project does not attempt to develop a rigid, 
complete data schema but rather to provide the object vocabulary and semantics 
for a large range of developments.

The SchemaBlocks site can be accessed though the permanent link 
[schemablocks.org](http://schemablocks.org). More information about the 
different products & formats can be found on the workstream sites. For 
reference, some of the original information about recommended formats and 
object hierarchies is kept in the 
[GA4GH Metadata repositories](https://ga4gh-metadata.github.io/SchemaBlocks/).
