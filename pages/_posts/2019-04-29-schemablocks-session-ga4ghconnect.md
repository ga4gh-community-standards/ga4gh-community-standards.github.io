During the first day of the 2019 GA4GHconnect meeting we had an open discussion session about the perceived need and future directions of the __{S}[B]__ initiative.

#### Take-aways from the Meeting

Peter Goodhand suggested to proceed over the next months, to work on the content & format of {S}[B], and use the next GA4GH steering committee call (September 2019) to present the project, for a discussion of a possible integration into the overall GA4GH strategy / roadmap.
